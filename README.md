# Cursorless Hats

This hosts some non-standard hat collections.

You can use the [put_hats.ps1](put_hats.ps1) script to manually install the hats now.
Place the script in the hat source folder, then run it and reload vscode.

Also, it looks like there will soon be the ability to configure cursorless to use a folder of you choosing ([PR](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/pull/1853)).
